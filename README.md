# JsonExample
This example demonstrate the implementation of JSON in swift 3.0

Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for display implementation of JSON in swift 3.

We have implemented this in two way,

1. Read .json file main bundle and process data.

2. Download and read the .json file from the url and process data.

To implement the second method we use .json file from http://www.learnswiftonline.com/ , You can check the link for more swift tutorial. Thanks !ðŸ’–
